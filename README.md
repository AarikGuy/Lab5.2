# Web Dev Starter Code

## Overview

TODO: Write a project description

## Sources and Credits

TODO: You must credit the sources and authors of any code, libraries, or other
assets you use in your project. If you leave this section blank, your project
will be considered in violation of the Academic Honesty policy unless you truly
created everything from scratch with no outside help. If you need to use a
source that you cannot credit (e.g. a classmate's work), you must get explicit
permission from your instructor.

A simple bulleted list below is sufficient. For example:

- Bootstrap: https://getbootstrap.com/
- jQuery: https://jquery.com/
- Background image: https://unsplash.com/photos/...
- Sound effects: https://freesound.org/people/...
- Icons: https://fontawesome.com/
- Fonts: https://fonts.google.com/
- etc.

## Accessibility Lab Answers

    Colors:

    The text is difficult to read because of the current color scheme. Can you do a test of the current color contrast (text/background), report the results of the test, and then fix it by changing the assigned colors?

    I changed the background color to a light blue so that the text is more readable. 

    Semantic HTML:

    1. The content is still not very accessible â€” report on what happens when you try to navigate it using a keyboard.

    Initially it wasn't letting me tab through the options but I fixed that.

    2. Can you update the article text to make it easier for screen reader users to navigate?

    I fixed the header stuff in html by changing the font=5,6,7 stuff to h1,h2,h3 respectively. 
    That fixed all the title stuff.

    3. The navigation menu part of the site (wrapped in <div class="nav"></div>) could be made more accessible by putting it in a proper HTML semantic element. Which one should it be updated to? Make the update.

    I changed it to nav.nav.
